        <p>
            A skill is a core ability in your game that defines specific actions and behaviors that a character or entity can perform.
            In the Skill System, a skill is composed of multiple actions, with each action defining part of the overall behavior of the skill.
        </p>

        <h2 id="creating-skill">Creating a Skill</h2>
        <p>
            To create a skill, add the SSSkill component to a GameObject. You can then start editing skill settings and adding actions to the skill.
            Each action can then be customized with specific functions that control its behavior.
        </p>

        <h2 id="action-index">Action Index</h2>
        <p>The action index specifies which action in a sequence will be played. It starts as "0" and will be increased when the target skill is executed.</p>

        <h2 id="skill-types">Skill Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Single:</span> These type of skills can only have one action and that action will be played when the skill is played. Action index is ignored. Every call consumes one charge.</li>
            <li><span>Random:</span> When the skill is played, one random action will be selected and played. Every call consumes one charge.</li>
            <li><span>In Order:</span> The actions will be played in order. Every call increases action index by one and consumes one charge.</li>
            <li><span id="chain-type">Chain:</span> When the skill is played, first action is executed and action index is increased by one.
                But, if the <a href="/?page=pages/Base_Concepts/Action.html#action-index-reset-delay" onclick="loadContent('pages/Base_Concepts/Action.html#action-index-reset-delay'); return false">Action Index Reset Delay</a>
                time expires, action index resets to zero. Resetting action index or executing all the actions consumes one charge.</li>

        <p>
            <span>- PlayNextAction()</span> This function triggers the next available action in the skill sequence, provided the skill has remaining charges and current
