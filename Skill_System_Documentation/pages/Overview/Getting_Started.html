        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            Getting started with the Skill System is simple and straightforward. By following just a few steps, you'll be able to integrate the system into your Unity project and start creating your first skills quickly. These steps help you get up and running with the system in no time.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Create a New Skill</h2>
        <p>
            Once the Skill System is downloaded, you can create a new skill by adding "SSSkill" component to a gameobject. This will generate a basic template for a new skill. You can then start editing skill settings and adding actions to the skill. Each action represents a specific functionality, and you can customize these actions based on the mechanics of your game. To add a new action, simply click the “Add Action” button and define what this action should do by adding functions to it.
        </p>
    
        <h2>2. Customize Skills and Actions</h2>
        <p>
            Customizing skills and actions is simple with the Skill System. For each action, you can define a series of functions to determine how it behaves. These functions are configurable, allowing you to tailor each action to your game's mechanics. By adjusting these functions, you can quickly test and refine skills to ensure they work as intended.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Rapid Iteration and Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Test your skills and change them until they’re right. In the Unity Editor, you can immediately see the results as you make changes. Keep testing, adjusting, and refining until everything works as expected.
