        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The Skill System is a modular framework designed specifically for Unity, enabling developers to create, manage, and fine-tune complex abilities and actions within their games.
            It simplifies the process of creating dynamic and flexible skills by breaking them down into individual components.
            Each skill consists of multiple actions, and every action contains a series of functions that define the specific behavior and effects of that action.
            This hierarchical structure not only keeps the code clean and organized but also allows for easy management and modification of skills throughout the development cycle.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Hierarchical Structure:</span> The Skill System is built around a hierarchical framework, where skills are composed of multiple actions, and each action contains a series of functions.
                This structure allows for a clear, organized representation of abilities and their components, making it easier to understand and modify complex skill sets.</li>
            <li><span>Flexible and Scalable:</span> Designed to be highly adaptable, the Skill System can be easily customized to suit different game genres and mechanics.
                Whether you're building an RPG, an action game, or any type of game that uses skills, the system can be scaled to meet the specific requirements of your game.</li>
            <li><span>Custom Editor:</span> The system comes with a Unity Inspector extension, providing a user-friendly interface for modifying and configuring skills without the need to write extensive code.
                This intuitive tool ensures that developers can create and tweak skills quickly, without needing to dive into the underlying code each time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Should I Use It?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the key benefits of using the Skill System is that it helps to avoid the need for hardcoded, repetitive logic.
            Instead of manually writing similar behavior for each skill or ability, you can leverage the modular framework to create reusable actions and functions.
            This reduces the chance of errors and inconsistencies across the game.
            Additionally, because the system is flexible and easy to use, it enables rapid iteration on skills, allowing developers to quickly test and refine abilities without wasting time on cumbersome processes.
            This means faster development cycles and more room for experimentation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>System Overview</h2>
        <p>
            At the core of the Skill System is its component-based design. Skills are created by composing a series of actions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the ability's behavior.
            Each action can be linked to a variety of functions that define things like object instantiation, animation triggers, moving objects, and more.
            This setup makes it possible to create complex and highly customizable skills while maintaining a clear and logical structure.
            Developers can easily add, remove, or modify actions and functions within each skill, enabling rapid customization and iteration.
            By using this modular approach, the system ensures that skills can evolve over time without requiring major rewrites.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            The Skill System is compatible with Unity 2020.3 and later versions.
